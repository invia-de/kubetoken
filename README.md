# kubetoken

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/invia-de/kubetoken.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atlassian/kubetoken)

## Synopsis

`kubetoken` issues temporary certificates for access to Kubernetes clusters.
 

## Build

run make build_container in Project directory

This will build a Container which can be started with make start_container with kubetokend inside running on 48080

Also, in this Container there is the Client kubetoken to connect to kubetokend

Building with -f Dockerfile-debianbuild creates a debian:stretch Container with .deb Packages in the workdir. They can be copied with docker cp \<container\>:/\<workdir\>/*.deb /tmp

Building with -f Dockerfile-buildFromGithub gets recent Version from github an build the binaries to the Container

## Installation

Installation is covered in a [seperate document](INSTALLATION.md).

## Deployment

Deploying kubetoken involves two steps.

1. deploying kubetokend as a kubernetes service
2. distributing the kubetoken cli tool.

## Usage

use kubetoken Client with 
```--host```
 poiting to the kubetokend server

the ```kubetoken --help``` Flag will Print Basic Usage.

kubetoken client will edit the ~/.kube/config with the proper Cluster Contexts for the chosen User

After kubetoken login one can view the Cluster Contexts configured with
```
kubectl config get-contexts
```
